# research

### This is created for my research called "stratospheric science" using JRA3Q ###
Use modulelist.py as a package like "numpy" or "xarray" and so on, and put this same directory as for file to use.

When you want to use it, write "import modulelist as ml", where "ml" is the name you want to use and naturaly up to you.

### CAUTION ###
#### 1 ####
Here, I use the "xarray". If you don't still have it, activate your poershell(windows) or terminal(Mac) and do "conda install xarray" or "pip install xarray".

#### 2 ####
The same as previous sentence, you need "netcdf4" to use this "nc" file. Try "conda install netcdf4" or "pip install netcdf4".
